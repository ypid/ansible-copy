  synopsis: |
    This role was written to be able to specify files to copy via inventory variables.
    It is based on Ansibleâ€™s [copy module].
    If the [synchronize module] seems more suitable checkout the role [ypid.synchronize].

    ### Features

    * Ensures that the target parent directory exists.
    * Allows to delete files defined as `state: 'absent'`.
